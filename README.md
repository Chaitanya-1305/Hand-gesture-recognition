Hand gesture recognition using Python involves detecting and interpreting hand movements for interaction. OpenCV captures and processes video frames, while NumPy efficiently handles array manipulations. Mediapipe offers pre-trained models for hand detection and tracking, simplifying gesture recognition. Matplotlib can visualize results, displaying key points and hand contours effectively.
